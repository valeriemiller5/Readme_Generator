# README Generator
This is app asks a series of questions in order to produce a simple README file. Users will open their terminal to answer their questions, then the program will generate the README file once completed. Please note: if a README already exists in the project file the user is working in, this app will replace the content of that file.

Cloning this repo and running the app in this project folder will replace this README with a new one created by the app.

## Demo
Please see the attached screenshots of a README generated with this app:
